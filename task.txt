***Design***
- Layout to match the provided designs
- Responsive - works on a range of devices (mobile, tablet, desktop(normal, large))

***Data***
- API: https://dummyjson.com
- The stock value relates to the stock bar 
    - you decide the threshold for ‘In stock’ vs ‘Last few left’
    - The pricing should be based on the price and discountPercentage values
- API incomplete - add dummy data (e.g PayPal credit available text)

***Required logic***
- Show exactly 10 products at random
- Exclude all products where brand is Apple
- Order products by the average review score descending
- 1 image per product (selected from the image array) *extra logic added
- ‘Add to basket’ -> log to console prod ID and price
- Refresh page >3 mins = fresh product data
- Refresh page <3 minutes = same products
- Local storage needed. The data stored should only be the values used in the UI (e.g there is no category)
- The countdown timer on each product card ‘Order in the next xx:xx:xx’ should count down until the data becomes stale (meaning a page refresh would get fresh product data) 
- Only the product(s) with the highest rating should have the ‘Eclipse recommended’ badge, pink border, the price in red and the ‘Save £xxx’ badge
